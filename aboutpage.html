      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I’m Nittyshry Prabhu, born on January 28, 2005, in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India. <b>I’m a passionate writer,
          creative imagineer, and aspiring engineer, blending analytical thinking with imaginative storytelling.</b>
        <br>

        I completed my schooling and higher secondary education in my village, Bhramarpur, Bhagalpur, where my curiosity
        for both science and creativity began to grow. Later, I moved to Delhi to pursue my dream of becoming an
        engineer. <br><br>

        Currently, I’m studying for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (AI & ML) at MIT, affiliated with Dr. A.P.J.
        Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow. Alongside my academic journey, I continue to explore literature, art,
        and innovation — always striving to push the boundaries of both my intellectual and creative pursuits.<br><br>

        <b>I always want to capture every moment that comes in my life (in my phone's camera, in my diary, in my mind so
          that I never forget it).</b>

        I live every moment always, whether it is a beautiful moment, sometimes a sad moment, sometimes a moment of
        struggle, every moment that comes in my life, friend.
      </p>
      <p>I am a passionate creative artist driven by the belief that art has the power to inspire, connect, and leave a
        lasting impact. My journey began with a deep love for storytelling, which gradually expanded into filmmaking,
        acting, and music composition. <br><br>
        Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering [ 3rd Year ], I balance academics
        with creativity, using my technical foundation to enhance my artistic vision. My goal is to craft meaningful
        films, powerful performances, and soulful music that resonate deeply with audiences. <br> <br>

        Though I never initially saw myself as a writer,<b> my perspective changed in 2021 (11th grade) when I realized
          the power of storytelling</b>. I decided to start writing with the dream of one day turning my scripts into
        films—stories that bring positive, impactful content to society. <br> <br>

        As a multifaceted creative, I constantly refine my skills in screenwriting, acting, editing, photography, and
        web design. I believe in collaborative growth and working with like-minded artists who share a passion for
        innovation and authentic storytelling. <br> <br>

        <i><b style="color: red;">My vision is clear: To create. To inspire. To leave a mark.</b></i>

      <h2>Journey Highlights</h2>
      <div class="timeline">
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h3>2008-2011 — Early Childhood Education - Anganwadi</h3>
          <b> <span>Education has always held the highest place in my family’s values. My parents have always believed
              that knowledge is the true foundation of life — and they’ve never hesitated to prioritize our learning
              above everything else. <br>

              When I was around three years old, they sent me to the nearby Anganwadi — just about fifty meters from our
              home. I still remember those early mornings when my mother and father would walk me there hand in hand.
              <br>

              The Anganwadi was beside the small Kali Mandir, barely thirty meters away from our house. It’s one of my
              earliest memories — though I don’t quite remember who else studied with me there, I clearly remember the
              warmth, care, and the quiet beginning of what would become my lifelong journey of learning.</span></b>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h3>2011-2019 — Primary School Education</h3>
          <b><span>As I grew a little older, my learning world expanded — and so did my routine.
              I began attending two schools at the same time. Once a week, usually on Monday or Tuesday, I would go to a
              nearby Government Prathmik Vidyalay. The rest of the week, I studied at a private school — SSP School.<br>
              From Class 1 to 8, these two places became two sides of my early learning journey — one simple and
              traditional, the other more structured and academic. <br>

              <b>During this phase, I met some truly special people who left a mark on my life. </b> <br>
              <i style="color: rgb(157, 157, 13);">In Class 5, I met my good friend Nitish, someone who made school days
                brighter and filled them with laughter and curiosity.</i> <br>
              <i style="color: purple;">And in Class 6, I met Riya — a person I’ll always be grateful for. She taught me
                how to see the world with beauty and simplicity, not just through books but through perspective. Her
                kindness and grace still inspire me today.</i> <br>

              Those years made learning feel interesting and alive.
              My parents constantly reminded me of the importance of education, and their words shaped how I looked at
              school — not as an obligation, but as an opportunity to grow every single day.</span></b>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h3>2019-2021 — High School / Secondary Education</h3>
          <b><span>After completing my primary education, I continued my studies in my own village — a place that always
              kept me close to my roots.<br>
              I joined Jairampur High School, a government school under the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB).
              <br>
              Those two years — Class 9 and 10 — were full of growth, discovery, and confidence.
              High school brought new experiences, new friends, and a deeper connection with learning.<br>
              Among all subjects, Mathematics became my favorite. I enjoyed solving problems, exploring patterns, and
              finding beauty in numbers — it made me feel focused, challenged, and excited at the same time.
              <br>
              My high school days were not just about academics; they also taught me discipline, patience, and the value
              of consistent effort.
              Living in my village during this time gave me balance — simplicity at home and curiosity in school.
              <br>
              I scored 86.8% in my 12th Examination.</span></b>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
          <h3>2021-2023 — Higher Secondary / Intermediate Education</h3>
          <b><span>I continued my studies in my village itself — completing Class 11 and 12 from Jairampur High School,
              under the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). <br>

              These two years quietly changed the way I looked at the world — and at myself.
              I began to notice things more deeply: the people around me, their struggles, their ways of thinking.
              Somewhere within, a shift started happening.<br>
              <i style="color: green;">I began to question, to explore, and to understand what truly mattered to me.
              </i><br>

              I’ve always been a sensitive and curious person, eager to see every detail, to know the “why” behind
              things.
              During this time, that curiosity turned inward — I started searching for myself.
              While most people around me followed the same line, I somehow felt drawn to a different path, one that was
              uniquely mine. <br>

              <i style="color: purple;">After about two years, I met Riya again. She seemed a bit changed — and perhaps,
                so was I.
                That meeting made me realize that life keeps moving, people evolve, and it’s up to us to keep growing —
                for ourselves and for those we care about.</i> <br><br>

              <i style="color: rgb(138, 138, 9);">My friend Nitish was still with me, though our ways of seeing the
                world had started to differ a little.</i> <br> <br>

              When I entered Class 12, I grew frustrated with the local teaching methods — they no longer inspired me.
              So, I stopped relying on classroom lessons and began self-studying, observing life, society, and the world
              more closely instead. <br>

              That phase taught me independence and self-discipline.
              When the results came, I scored 76.4% in my 12th exams — a mark that meant more than numbers; it reflected
              my journey of understanding, effort, and quiet growth.</span></b>
