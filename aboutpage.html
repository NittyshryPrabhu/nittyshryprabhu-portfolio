      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I’m Nittyshry Prabhu, born on January 28, 2005, in Bhagalpur, Bihar, India. <b>I’m a passionate writer,
          creative imagineer, and aspiring engineer, blending analytical thinking with imaginative storytelling.</b>
        <br>

        I completed my schooling and higher secondary education in my village, Bhramarpur, Bhagalpur, where my curiosity
        for both science and creativity began to grow. Later, I moved to Delhi to pursue my dream of becoming an
        engineer. <br><br>

        Currently, I’m studying for a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (AI & ML) at MIT, affiliated with Dr. A.P.J.
        Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow. Alongside my academic journey, I continue to explore literature, art,
        and innovation — always striving to push the boundaries of both my intellectual and creative pursuits.<br><br>

        <b>I always want to capture every moment that comes in my life (in my phone's camera, in my diary, in my mind so
          that I never forget it).</b>

        I live every moment always, whether it is a beautiful moment, sometimes a sad moment, sometimes a moment of
        struggle, every moment that comes in my life, friend.
      </p>
      <p>I am a passionate creative artist driven by the belief that art has the power to inspire, connect, and leave a
        lasting impact. My journey began with a deep love for storytelling, which gradually expanded into filmmaking,
        acting, and music composition. <br><br>
        Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering [ 3rd Year ], I balance academics
        with creativity, using my technical foundation to enhance my artistic vision. My goal is to craft meaningful
        films, powerful performances, and soulful music that resonate deeply with audiences. <br> <br>

        Though I never initially saw myself as a writer,<b> my perspective changed in 2021 (11th grade) when I realized
          the power of storytelling</b>. I decided to start writing with the dream of one day turning my scripts into
        films—stories that bring positive, impactful content to society. <br> <br>

        As a multifaceted creative, I constantly refine my skills in screenwriting, acting, editing, photography, and
        web design. I believe in collaborative growth and working with like-minded artists who share a passion for
        innovation and authentic storytelling. <br> <br>

        <i><b style="color: red;">My vision is clear: To create. To inspire. To leave a mark.</b></i>

          <h3>About My Experiences</h3>
          <b><span>When I look back at my journey, I see not just years, but a chain of surprises that shaped me into who I am today. Every stage of life has carried its own lessons, its own struggles, and its own hidden beauty.<br>

<b>Birth:</b> <br>
    My life began with rain falling hard outside, when I was born at home instead of a hospital. Even from the start, I was different from my siblings. God kept me safe, and that first surprise gave me my first reason for gratitude.
<br>
<b>Childhood: </b><br>
    As the first son, I carried both love and responsibility. My parents gave me the chance to study in a private hostel, something no one in my family had before me. With my badi didi by my side, my childhood was filled with laughter and shared memories.<br>

<b>Teenage:</b> <br>
    I grew up with simplicity — sometimes with only two sets of clothes to wear, carrying shyness and low confidence. Yet, teenage also gave me people who changed my life: Riya, who taught me love, respect, and understanding, and Nitish, my closest friend, who still remains by my side.
<br>
<b>College: </b><br>
    I stepped into engineering, even though I once believed education was a scam. Life surprised me again by placing me in CSE (AIML). Hostel life, however, was not what I dreamed of. Friendships were hard, roommates often troubled me, and struggles became a daily part of my routine. Yet, my ambition — to become great and successful — keeps my hope alive.
<br>
<b>Life Lessons: </b><br>
    Every step has taught me something: behind every light, there is a hidden story. Behind every struggle, there is a lesson. Behind every relationship, there is a truth we may or may not see. These lessons keep me moving forward, even when life feels uncertain.
<br>
Through all these experiences, one truth has never left me: life will always surprise us. Sometimes with joy, sometimes with struggle, sometimes with love, and sometimes with pain. But every surprise is a teacher, every experience is a gift.
<br>
And so, when I think about my journey, I smile and say once more: <br>
    I am surprised again.</span></b>
